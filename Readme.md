# Steam Friends Game Finder

Tiny tool to find some common games among you and your friends. So the next time you are overwhelmed by your 500+ games steam library, run this and you know what games all of you actually own.
You'll need to know your (and your friends) SteamId and create a Steam API key here (only takes a login): https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey

To install, use pip:
`sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
